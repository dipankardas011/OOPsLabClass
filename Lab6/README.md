# Questions

1. (Single Inheritance) Write a program to create a class CIRCLE with one field as radius, used to calculate the area of a Circle. Create another class RECTANGLE used to calculate the area of the rectangle which is a subclass of CIRCLE class. Use the concept of single inheritance such that the radius of circle class can be re-used as length in rectangle class. Take necessary data members and member functions for both the classes to solve this problem. All the data members are initialized through the constructors. Show the result by accessing the area method of both the classes through the objects of rectangle class.✅

2. Create a class student which stores name, roll number and age of a student. Derive a class
test from student class, which stores marks in 5 subjects. Input and display the details of
a student.✅

3. (Multilevel Inheritance) Extend the program 2 to derive a class result from class ‘test’ which includes member function to calculate total marks and percentage of a student. Input the data for a student and display its total marks and percentage.✅

4. WAP in C++ depicting the use of multiple inheritance. (No ambiguity)✅

5. WAP in C++ depicting the use of multiple inheritance with ambiguity and resolve the same by (a) :: Scope Resolution Operator   (b) function overriding✅

6. Write a program to create a class called STUDENT with data members Roll Number, Name and Age. Using inheritance, create the classes UGSTUDENT and PGSTUDENT having fields a semester, fees and stipend. Enter the data for at least 5 students. Find the average age for all UG and PG students separately.✅
