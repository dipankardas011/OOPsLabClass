# Questions

1. Create a class TIME with member’s hour, minute and second. Write a program that adds two
time objects. The objects must be passed as function arguments.✅
2. Create a class distance which stores a distance in feet and inches. Input 2 distance values in objects, add them, store the resultant distance in and object and display it. [Write the above program in two ways.
a) store the resultant distance in the calling object:C3.add(C1,C2)
b) return the resultant object C3=C1.add(C2)✅
3. Write a program to find out the area of a rectangle through friend function and member
function separately of Rectangle class.✅
4. Write a program to find out the greatest between two numbers defined in two different classes by using friend function.✅
5. Write a program to perform addition of two complex numbers using constructor.
Complex numbers are given through user input.✅
6. Write a program to perform addition of two complex numbers using constructor overloading. The first constructor which takes no argument is used to create objects which are not initialized, second which takes one argument is used to initialize real and imaginary parts to equal values and third which takes two argument is used to initialize real and imaginary to two different values.✅
7. Write a program to generate a fibonacci series using copy constructor.✅
8. WAP in C++ which will implement the concept of Parameterized constructor with
implicit and explicit call.✅
